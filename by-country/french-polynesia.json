With the halt of French nuclear testing in 1996, the military contribution to the economy fell sharply.\n\nAfter growing at an average yearly rate of 4.2% from 1997-2007, the economic and financial crisis in 2008 marked French Polynesias entry into recession. However, since 2014, French Polynesia has shown signs of recovery. Business turnover reached 1.8% year-on-year in September 2016, tourism increased 1.8% in 2015, and GDP grew 2.0% in 2015.\n\nFrench Polynesias tourism-dominated service sector accounted for 85% of total value added for the economy in 2012. Tourism employs 17% of the workforce. Pearl farming is the second biggest industry, accounting for 54% of exports in 2015; however, the output has decreased to 12.5 tons  the lowest level since 2008. A small manufacturing sector predominantly processes commodities from French Polynesias primary sector - 8% of total economy in 2012 - including agriculture and fishing.\n\nFrance has agreed to finance infrastructure, marine businesses, and cultural and ecological sites at roughly $80 million per year between 2015 and 2020.
