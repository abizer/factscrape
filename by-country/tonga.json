The country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand.\n\nThe country remains dependent on external aid and remittances from overseas Tongans to offset its trade deficit. The government is emphasizing the development of the private sector, encouraging investment, and is committing increased funds for health care and education. Tonga's English-speaking and educated workforce offer a viable labor market, and the tropical climate provides fertile soil. Renewable energy and deep-sea mining also offer opportunities for investment.\n\nTonga has a reasonably sound basic infrastructure and well developed social services.
