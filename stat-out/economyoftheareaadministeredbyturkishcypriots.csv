Cyprus,"Economy - overview: The market-based economy of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots, known locally as the ""Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"" (""TRNC""), is roughly half the size of its southern neighbor and is likewise dominated by the service sector with a large portion of the population employed by the government. Since its creation, the ""TRNC"" has heavily relied on financial assistance from Turkey which supports the ""TRNC"" defense, telecommunications, water and postal services, and the ""TRNC"" remains vulnerable to the Turkish market and monetary policy through its use of the Turkish Lira. The ""TRNC"" weathered the European financial crisis relatively unscathed-compared to the Republic of Cyprus-because of the lack of financial sector development, health of the Turkish economy, and its separation from the rest of the island.
